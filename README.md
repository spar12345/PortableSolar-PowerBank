# PortableSolar-PowerBank
This portable solar power bank uses a lithium-ion battery charged via a solar panel. An Arduino monitors the battery voltage. If the battery is fully charged, it stops charging. If the voltage drops too low, it cuts off discharging to prevent battery damage. This extends battery life and ensures safety
